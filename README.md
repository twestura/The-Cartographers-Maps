## Map History

A variety of authors have contributed to Aoe2's map scripting scene over the years.
It's not always easy to track down the original of certain maps, but here I'll attempt to provide a history as best I can find it of the original authors and various maintainers of the maps.

### Arabia

The most standard Aoe2 map there is, the original version by Ensemble Studios was the bread and butter of AoC.
The particular version from this tournament is based on the version in Aoe2 DE from October 2023, authored by Chrazini.

### Arena

The best circus in town.
The map was originally included by Ensemble Studios in the Conquerors Expansion.
I've mostly rewritten this version from scratch.
The technique of generating forest lands in a circle is inspired by ideas seen in various Arena versions by Chrazini (e.g. Clown Arena).

### Black Forest

The original BF is a classic Aoe2 map from the original game, updated in AoC to include an additional South American jungle biome.
Usually BF is a 4v4 map, and the Rage Forest community maintains one of the most popular versions.

I rewrote this version, basing it mostly off of the version from AoC (in particular I do not use any of DE's Generating Objects code like Rage Forest does).
Most noteworth is the attempt to balance ponds by creating them in Land Generation rather than in Terrain Generation.

### Colosseum
